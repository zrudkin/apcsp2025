        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Zoe Rudkin and I am a junior at Rancho Bernardo Highschool. Throughout my three years at RBHS, I have taken 3 AP's, and this semester, 4 more are in progress right now. I am very academically and goal driven, and Is trive to do my very best in everything I do. I plan to major in biomedical engineering because I want to help others, even if I'm not directly helping or diagnosing, I think it would be amazing for me to be able contribute to the researching, designing, engineering, and testing that goes into the creation of technology that improves life and recovery.</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Zoe Rudkin and I am a junior at Rancho Bernardo Highschool. Throughout my three years at RBHS, I have taken 3 AP's, and this semester, 4 more are in progress right now. I am very academically and goal driven, and Is trive to do my very best in everything I do. I plan to major in biomedical engineering because I want to help others, even if I'm not directly helping or diagnosing, I think it would be amazing for me to be able contribute to the researching, designing, engineering, and testing that goes into the creation of technology that improves life and recovery. To further my interest in biomedical technology, I plan to do an internship over the summer where I work side-by-side with researchers and engineers to help aid them in their research.</p>
